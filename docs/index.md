# Welcome to the C-SCALE documentation

C-SCALE's purpose is to federate Earth Observation service providers and
offer users the posibility to access, process, analyse and share Copernicus
data, tools, resources and services through the [EOSC Portal](https://eosc-portal.eu/).

Please visit the [C-SCALE](https://c-scale.eu/) website to learn more about the
mission and vision.

If you want to become a provider in the federation, please follow the documents
under the [providers section](c-scale-providers/getting-started/).

If you intent to use the federation for your projects, please follow the instructions
under the [users section](c-scale-users/getting-started/).
