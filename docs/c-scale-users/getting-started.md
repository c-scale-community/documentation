# Getting started

C-SCALE's vision is to empower European researchers, institutions and initiatives
to easily discover, access, process, analyse and share Copernicus data, tools,
resources and services through the [EOSC Portal](https://eosc-portal.eu/)
in a way that can be seamlessly integrated into their processes and research practices.

Please visit the [C-SCALE](https://c-scale.eu/) for more information.
